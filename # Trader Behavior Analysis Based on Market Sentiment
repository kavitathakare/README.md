   - Daily PnL per trader
   - Win rate
   - Average trade size
   - Trade frequency
   - Long/Short ratio
   - Drawdown proxy (average negative PnL)

3. Behavioral & Performance Analysis
   - Compared Fear vs Greed performance
   - Measured changes in trade size and frequency
   - Analyzed directional bias

4. Trader Segmentation
   - Frequent vs Infrequent traders
   - High vs Low position size traders
   - Consistent vs Inconsistent traders

#Key Insights

1. Trader profitability differs between Fear and Greed periods.
2. Traders take larger position sizes during Greed periods, indicating higher risk appetite.
3. Directional bias shifts with sentiment — more long trades during Greed, more short trades during Fear.



# Strategy Recommendations

1. Adaptive Position Sizing:
   Reduce exposure slightly during Greed periods to manage drawdown risk.

2. Sentiment-Based Directional Bias:
   Favor long positions during Greed and hedging/short setups during Fear.
