# Summary

This analysis explores how trader performance and behavior vary across market sentiment regimes (Fear vs Greed).

The results show that traders exhibit higher risk-taking behavior during Greed periods, as reflected by increased position sizes and directional bias toward long trades. Profitability patterns also differ across sentiment conditions.

Based on these findings, sentiment-adaptive trading strategies are recommended to improve risk-adjusted performance.
